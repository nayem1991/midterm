    /** A Map (in the API reference documentation) is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value.
     * The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: HashMap (in the API reference documentation), TreeMap (in the API reference documentation), and LinkedHashMap (in the API reference documentation). Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap, as described in the section The Set Interface (in the Collections trail). Also, Hashtable was retrofitted to implement Map.
     * The Map interface includes methods for basic operations (such as put, get, remove, containsKey, containsValue, size, and empty), bulk operations (such as putAll and clear), and collection views (such as keySet, entrySet, and values).
     * The Java platform contains three general-purpose Map implementations: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap. Their behavior and performance are precisely analogous to HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet, as described in The Set Interface section
