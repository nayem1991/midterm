     * Read System JDK 8 API documantation to be read and System source code to be viewed
     * Demonastrate your understanding on System after reading the documentation
     * Show some uses of System Class
     * Explain, what is System.out.println()?
     * List all the members of the System class, such as class variable, instance variables, local variables
     * method type etc
     *
     * The System class contains several useful class fields and methods. It cannot be instantiated.
     * Among the facilities provided by the System class are standard input, standard output, and error output streams; access to externally defined properties and environment variables; a means of loading files and libraries; and a utility method for quickly copying a portion of an array.
     *lass UserNameTest {
     *     public static void main(String[] args) {
     *         String name;
     *         name = System.getProperty("user.name");
     *         System.out.println(name);
     *     }
     * }
     *The print and println methods are essentially the same; they both write their String argument to the stream. The one difference between the two methods is that println appends a newline character to the end of its output while print does not. In other words, this
     *
     * System.out.print("Duke is not a penguin!\n");
     * is equivalent to this
     * System.out.println("Duke is not a penguin!");
     * Notice the extra \n in the first method call; it'
     * the two-character code for a newline character. println automatically appends a newline character to its output.
     *1) System.out: standard output stream
     * 2) System.in: standard input stream
     * 3) System.err: standard error stream
     * */
